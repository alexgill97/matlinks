# Completed Tasks

## Date Utilities Implementation

- **Status**: ✅ Completed
- **Date**: 2025-04-16

### Tasks Completed

1. Created a comprehensive date utilities module using date-fns with the following functions:
   - `formatDate` - Format dates with customizable format strings
   - `isDateInPast` - Check if a date is in the past
   - `getDateRangeForPeriod` - Get date ranges for week/month/year periods
   - `formatDateRange` - Format date ranges as strings
   - `getRelativeTimeString` - Get relative time descriptions (e.g., "2 days ago")
   - `parseISODate` - Parse ISO date strings
   - `generateDateRange` - Generate arrays of sequential dates
   - `groupByDate` - Group objects by date fields

2. Created comprehensive unit tests for all date utility functions

3. Created detailed documentation in README.md

### Implementation Notes

The date utilities were implemented using date-fns, which provides a comprehensive set of functions for working with dates. The implementation follows functional programming principles, with each function having a single responsibility.

All functions have been thoroughly tested and are working as expected. The documentation provides clear examples of how to use each function.

### Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements could include:
- Additional date formatting options
- Date comparison functions
- Date validation functions
- Calendar-specific utilities for the scheduling system

## Payment Retry Utilities Implementation

- **Status**: ✅ Completed
- **Date**: 2025-04-16

### Tasks Completed

1. Created a payment utilities module for handling failed payments and retry logic:
   - Defined enum types for payment failure types and retry status
   - Created interfaces for retry attempts and failed payment records
   - Implemented retry schedule configuration 
   - Built functions for generating retry dates
   - Created functions for creating and updating payment retry attempts
   - Added utility functions for checking retry status and formatting retry information

2. Created comprehensive unit tests for all payment utility functions

3. Updated documentation in README.md to include payment utilities

### Implementation Notes

The payment utilities provide a robust system for handling failed payments with automatic retry scheduling. The implementation includes:

- A configurable retry schedule that defaults to 1, 3, and 7 days
- Support for different types of payment failures (insufficient funds, expired card, etc.)
- Status tracking for retry attempts (scheduled, processing, succeeded, failed, cancelled)
- Helper functions for formatting retry information and managing retry attempts

These utilities will serve as the foundation for implementing the advanced billing features, specifically the payment failure handling and retry system.

## Current Development Status

### In Progress

We're currently working on two key areas:

1. **Advanced Billing Features**
   - ✅ Implemented core payment failure handling and retry logic
   - Next: Build notification system for failed payments
   - Next: Add admin interface for manual intervention

2. **Advanced Analytics Dashboard**
   - Creating financial analytics modules with detailed revenue breakdown
   - Implementing data visualization for business metrics
   - Building filtering capabilities for different date ranges

### Next Steps

Our task plan for the coming days:

1. Complete the payment failure notification system
   - Implement email notification templates for payment failures
   - Create notification scheduling for retry attempts
   - Develop admin notification system for persistent failures

2. Build admin interface for failed payment management
   - Create dashboard view for failed payments
   - Implement manual retry functionality
   - Add payment method update workflow for customers

3. Continue work on the financial analytics module
   - Implement revenue breakdown by different categories
   - Create profit margin visualization with date-based filtering
   - Add export functionality for reports
