This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## Payment Method Management

To set up payment method management and view payment history, follow these steps:

1. Install Stripe packages:
   ```bash
   npm install @stripe/react-stripe-js @stripe/stripe-js --legacy-peer-deps
   ```

2. Create a Stripe account and add your API keys to the environment variables:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_publishable_key
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_secret_key
   ```

3. For local development, set up the Stripe CLI for webhooks:
   ```bash
   stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe
   ```

The payment management interface allows students to:
- Add, view, and remove payment methods
- View their payment history
- Manage subscription payments
